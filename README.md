# KeyPong - If Typeracer and PingPong had a baby.

One Friday I got a challenge from a fellow collegue at work to build a multiplayer game using Socket.io.
The game had to be like a 2D PingPong but instead of hitting the ball with your mouse, you had to quickly type a word.

For the server I use Express and Socket.io to communicate with the front-end.
All game animations are done with PIXI.js.
